  <p>A passionate photojournalist currently residing in Columbia, MO. My love for photography started when I joined my high school yearbook, were I got my first camera and learned how to us it.</p>
  <p>My friends and family would describe me as an eclectic and exuberant personality. I believe that my personality is reflected in my photos, and though you may not know me personally, hopefully you can get to know me through my work.</p>
