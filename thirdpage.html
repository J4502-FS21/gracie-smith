    <p>What is the first thing that people think of when they hear disability? Most likely, it’s probably a disability that can be seen. A person could have an abnormal gait due to their spinal cord and have to ride a wheelchair. A person may have trouble keeping their balance as they walk and will use a cane to help them. A person may even have just broken their leg and needs to use crutches until the leg gets better. These are all types of disabilities. But what about the ones you can’t see? </p>
    <p>Instead of having an abnormal gait or trouble balancing, a person could have cognitive or mental issues. Invisible disabilities are those that can’t immediately be seen on a person, but can still affect their lives. About 25% of adult Americans have some type of disability, with 20% of them having an invisible one. With invisible disabilities being unseen to the average eye, it might be even harder to know what can help. People might be too afraid to admit their disabilities to others. They might be even more afraid to admit the things that can help them due to the possibility of discrimination. However, even if it seems minor, the things that can help with an invisible disability can feel massive.</p>
